### Design Movement: Clinical Clarity (Neumorphism inspired)
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Cognitive Ease:** Minimize visual noise to prevent distraction. Every element has a clear purpose.
2.  **Tactile Feedback:** Use soft shadows and highlights to make interactive elements feel physical and pressable.
3.  **High Contrast & Accessibility:** Ensure target stimuli stand out clearly against the background.
4.  **Professional Trust:** A clean, medical-grade aesthetic that feels like a serious rehabilitation tool.

**Color Philosophy:**
-   **Base:** Soft off-white or very light cool gray background to reduce eye strain.
-   **Primary:** Medical Blue (#007AFF) for primary actions and active states, symbolizing calm and trust.
-   **Target Stimuli:** Bright, distinct colors (e.g., Amber or Coral) that glow when active, contrasting sharply with the neutral background.
-   **Intent:** To create a sterile but welcoming environment where the user can focus entirely on the task without emotional overload.

**Layout Paradigm:**
-   **Centralized Focus:** The game area is the absolute center. Controls (timer, score) are peripheral but clearly legible.
-   **Floating Islands:** UI elements (settings, scoreboards) float on the background with soft neumorphic shadows, separating them from the game layer.

**Signature Elements:**
-   **Soft-pressed Buttons:** Buttons that look like they are physically depressed when clicked.
-   **Halo Glow:** The target "light" emits a soft, diffusing glow to attract attention without being harsh.
-   **Clean Typography:** Sans-serif, highly legible numbers and labels.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
-   **Immediate Response:** Instant visual feedback (depression of button, color change) upon interaction.
-   **Deliberate Pacing:** Transitions are smooth but quick, maintaining the rhythm of the exercise.

**Animation:**
-   **Pulse:** The target light pulses gently if not clicked within a certain time (optional cue).
-   **Ripple:** A subtle ripple effect extends from the click point to confirm input.

**Typography System:**
-   **Font:** Inter or Roboto (optimized for screen legibility).
-   **Hierarchy:** Large, bold numbers for Score and Timer. Medium weight for labels.

### Design Movement: Playful Pop (Retro Arcade inspired)
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Gamification:** Make rehabilitation feel like a game to boost motivation.
2.  **Vibrant Energy:** Use bold colors and shapes to stimulate engagement.
3.  **Reward-Centric:** Emphasize positive feedback (score pop-ups, confetti) to encourage progress.
4.  **Dynamic Motion:** The interface feels alive and energetic.

**Color Philosophy:**
-   **Base:** Deep Indigo or Dark Purple background to make lights pop.
-   **Primary:** Neon Green, Hot Pink, and Cyan for interactive elements.
-   **Target Stimuli:** Glowing neon circles or stars.
-   **Intent:** To evoke the excitement of an arcade game, reducing the feeling of "work" or "therapy."

**Layout Paradigm:**
-   **Arcade HUD:** Score and timer are displayed in a "Heads Up Display" style at the top corners.
-   **Full-Screen Canvas:** The entire screen is the play area, maximizing the range of attention required.

**Signature Elements:**
-   **Pixel Art / 8-bit Accents:** Subtle nods to retro gaming in icons or borders (optional, but the vibe is there).
-   **Neon Borders:** UI containers have glowing edges.
-   **Particle Effects:** Sparks or stars fly when a target is successfully clicked.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
-   **Juicy Feedback:** "Juice" the interactions—screen shake (subtle), sound effects, and visual flares on every success.
-   **High Energy:** Fast transitions and bouncy animations.

**Animation:**
-   **Pop-in:** Targets appear with a bouncy "pop" animation.
-   **Score Float:** Points float up from the clicked location.

**Typography System:**
-   **Font:** Press Start 2P (for headers/score) paired with a clean geometric sans (e.g., Poppins) for readability.
-   **Hierarchy:** Score is massive and central during gameplay.

### Design Movement: Zen Focus (Nature/Organic inspired)
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Mindfulness:** The activity is treated as a moving meditation.
2.  **Organic Shapes:** Avoid sharp corners; use fluid, rounded forms.
3.  **Calm Progression:** Success is marked by harmony rather than excitement.
4.  **Natural Flow:** Animations mimic natural movements (breathing, flowing water).

**Color Philosophy:**
-   **Base:** Warm Beige, Sage Green, or Soft Earth tones.
-   **Primary:** Muted Forest Green or Terracotta.
-   **Target Stimuli:** Softly glowing fireflies or blooming flowers.
-   **Intent:** To reduce anxiety and promote a state of relaxed concentration (flow state).

**Layout Paradigm:**
-   **Open Space:** Minimal UI. Score and timer are unobtrusive, perhaps integrated into natural elements (e.g., a growing plant for score).
-   **Asymmetric Balance:** Elements are placed to feel balanced but not rigidly gridded.

**Signature Elements:**
-   **Frosted Glass:** UI overlays use a blurred, frosted glass effect to blend with the background.
-   **Organic Targets:** Instead of abstract circles, targets could be abstract organic shapes that "bloom."
-   **Ambient Background:** A subtle, slow-moving gradient or texture in the background.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
-   **Gentle Touch:** Interactions feel soft and yielding.
-   **Harmonious Feedback:** Visuals blend and flow rather than pop and explode.

**Animation:**
-   **Fade & Bloom:** Targets fade in and bloom gently.
-   **Drift:** UI elements drift slightly like leaves on water.

**Typography System:**
-   **Font:** Nunito or Quicksand (rounded sans-serifs).
-   **Hierarchy:** Soft, rounded numbers and text that feel friendly and approachable.
